# XoX Server CLI - Fun for Everyone! ðŸŽ®

Hey there! ðŸ˜„

Welcome to **XoX Server** â€“ it's a super cool tool I made to help manage game servers like Minecraft, Terraria, tModLoader, and more! You know those games we love? Well, this helps keep them running smoothly so we can play anytime! ðŸŽ®

## How to Get It Working

Let's get started! Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, grab the code from the internet and put it on your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xox-server.git
   ```
   
2. **Build the Project**  
   Next, we need to put all the pieces together. Go to the folder where you put the code and run this:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```
   
3. **Start the Magic**  
   Now, let's start the XoX Server and make the magic happen:
   ```bash
   xox-server
   ```

## How It Works

Once it's all set up, XoX Server helps us keep our favorite game servers running. It even talks to Steam to make sure everything is up to date! And guess what? It uses something called `screen` to keep everything running in the background, so we can close the terminal and the server will still be there, ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

Let's play and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
